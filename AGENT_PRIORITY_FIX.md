# AGENT PRIORITY FIX - Use Player's Actual Agent

## Problem Identified
The system was using **default agent** `AG72360789` instead of the **player's actual agent**:

```
❌ WRONG: Using AG72360789 as default
✅ CORRECT: Using AG77335206 (player MKP0103's actual agent with shan_code MK77)
```

## From your user_shan.sql:
- **Player MKP0103** (ID: 16): `agent_id: 15`, `shan_agent_code: 'MK77'`
- **Agent AG77335206** (ID: 15): `shan_agent_code: 'MK77'` ← **This is the correct agent**
- **Agent AG72360789** (ID: 3): Should NOT be used unless it's the player's actual agent

## Fixed Agent Priority Logic

### **NEW PRIORITY ORDER:**

1. **🥇 FIRST PRIORITY: Player's Shan Agent Code**
   ```php
   // Find by player's shan_agent_code (e.g., MKP0103 has 'MK77')
   $agent = User::where('shan_agent_code', $firstPlayer->shan_agent_code)
               ->where('type', 20)->first();
   ```

2. **🥈 SECOND PRIORITY: Player's Direct Agent ID**
   ```php
   // Find by player's agent_id (e.g., MKP0103 has agent_id: 15)
   $agent = User::find($firstPlayer->agent_id);
   ```

3. **🥉 THIRD PRIORITY: Banker (with warning)**
   ```php
   // Only if player has no agent - log warning
   Log::warning('Player should have their own agent, not use banker as agent');
   ```

4. **🆘 FOURTH PRIORITY: Common Agent Codes (fallback)**
   ```php
   // Fallback search by common codes: ['MK77', 'A3H4', 'A3H2']
   Log::warning('Player should be assigned to a proper agent');
   ```

5. **🚨 LAST RESORT: Any Available Agent (error)**
   ```php
   // Emergency fallback with error log
   Log::error('Player must be properly assigned to an agent!');
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

For your example transaction with **player MKP0103**:

### **BEFORE (Wrong):**
```
[INFO] Found agent from banker data: AG72360789
```

### **AFTER (Correct):**
```
[INFO] Found PLAYER'S ACTUAL AGENT by shan_agent_code: AG77335206 (MK77)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **✅ Correct Agent Assignment**: Each player uses their actual agent
2. **✅ Better Logging**: Clear priority and warnings when fallbacks are used  
3. **✅ Data Integrity**: Transactions properly attributed to correct agent
4. **✅ Debugging**: Easy to identify when players aren't properly assigned

## Test Your Fix

Send the same transaction and you should see:
- **Player MKP0103** → **Agent AG77335206** (not AG72360789)
- Log: `"Found PLAYER'S ACTUAL AGENT by shan_agent_code"`
- Proper agent balance updates for the correct agent

The system now prioritizes the **player's actual agent relationship** over any default or banker agents!
