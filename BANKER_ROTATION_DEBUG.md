# BANKER ROTATION DEBUG & FIX

## Problem Analysis
`SKP0101` is being used as a **fixed default banker** instead of rotating, causing the game to stop after one transaction.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue is likely **client-side logic** that always sends `SKP0101` as banker instead of rotating between players.

### From Your Logs:
```
✅ Transaction with SKP0101 as banker completes successfully
❌ But game stops because client doesn't rotate to next banker
```

## The Fix: Enhanced Rotation Support

### **1. Better Banker Detection & Logging**
```php
// NEW: Detailed logging to identify rotation issues
'potential_issue' => $bankerPlayerId === 'SKP0101' ? 
    'Always_same_banker_might_indicate_client_rotation_issue' : 
    'Different_banker_good'
```

### **2. Enhanced Response for Client Guidance**
```json
{
  "game_info": {
    "current_banker": "SKP0101",
    "banker_type": "player",
    "game_continues": true,
    "can_rotate_banker": true,
    "suggested_next_bankers": ["PLAYER0101", "OTHER_PLAYER"],
    "rotation_note": "Client should rotate banker to different player for next round"
  }
}
```

### **3. Rotation Status Indicators**
```json
{
  "rotation_status": "ready",
  "next_banker_rotation": "ready",
  "game_status": "completed_ready_for_next_round"
}
```

## Expected Client Behavior

### **Correct Rotation Pattern:**
```json
// Round 1: SKP0101 is banker
{"banker": {"player_id": "SKP0101"}, "players": ["PLAYER0101"]}

// Round 2: PLAYER0101 should be banker (CLIENT must rotate)
{"banker": {"player_id": "PLAYER0101"}, "players": ["SKP0101"]}

// Round 3: Different player should be banker
{"banker": {"player_id": "ANOTHER_PLAYER"}, "players": ["SKP0101", "PLAYER0101"]}
```

### **Current Problem Pattern:**
```json
// Round 1: SKP0101 is banker ✅
{"banker": {"player_id": "SKP0101"}, "players": ["PLAYER0101"]}

// Round 2: STILL SKP0101 as banker ❌ (Should rotate!)
{"banker": {"player_id": "SKP0101"}, "players": ["PLAYER0101"]}

// Game stops because no rotation
```

## Solution Steps

### **Server-Side (Done ✅):**
1. ✅ **Proper player-banker handling**
2. ✅ **Clear rotation status in response**
3. ✅ **Suggested next bankers list**
4. ✅ **Better logging for debugging**

### **Client-Side (Needs Implementation):**
1. 🔄 **Rotate banker after each round**
2. 🔄 **Use different player as banker each turn**
3. 🔄 **Don't always use SKP0101 as banker**

## Testing Your Fix

### **Test Case 1: Manual Rotation**
Send requests with different bankers:
```bash
# Round 1
POST /api/v1/shan-transaction-create
{"banker": {"player_id": "SKP0101"}, "players": [...]}

# Round 2 (Rotate banker)
POST /api/v1/shan-transaction-create  
{"banker": {"player_id": "PLAYER0101"}, "players": [...]}

# Round 3 (Rotate again)
POST /api/v1/shan-transaction-create
{"banker": {"player_id": "ANOTHER_PLAYER"}, "players": [...]}
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Each transaction completes successfully
- ✅ Game continues after each round
- ✅ Different bankers handle different rounds
- ✅ Response shows `"game_continues": true`

## Key Insight
**The server-side is now working correctly.** The issue is likely that your **client-side game logic** needs to implement **banker rotation** instead of always using `SKP0101`.

The server now provides:
- ✅ **Clear rotation indicators**
- ✅ **Suggested next bankers**
- ✅ **Game continuation status**
- ✅ **Debugging information**

**Next Step**: Update your client-side logic to rotate the banker between players for each round!
