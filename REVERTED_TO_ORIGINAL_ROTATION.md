# REVERTED TO ORIGINAL ROTATION SYSTEM

## Changes Made ✅

**Reverted the `ShanTransactionController` back to the original, working rotation system** before all the complex banker rotation logic was added.

## What Was Removed

### ❌ **Complex Player-Banker Logic:**
- Player banker detection (`$isPlayerBanker`)
- Player banker rotation logic
- Banker type differentiation
- Complex rotation status responses
- Player-as-banker processing

### ❌ **Advanced Agent Lookup:**
- Multiple priority agent lookup
- Banker-based agent fallback
- Emergency agent fallback with warnings
- Complex agent priority logic

### ❌ **Rotation Response Features:**
- `game_info` section with rotation status
- `suggested_next_bankers` array
- `rotation_note` and `can_rotate_banker`
- Player banker type indicators

## What Was Restored ✅

### **🎯 Simple, Working Logic:**
```php
// Always use agent as banker
$banker = $agent;

// Simple agent lookup:
1. Find by player's shan_agent_code
2. Fallback to player's agent_id  
3. Fallback to banker data
4. Last resort: any available agent
```

### **📋 Clean Transaction Flow:**
1. ✅ **Validate request** (same as before)
2. ✅ **Find first player** (simple lookup)
3. ✅ **Find agent** (straightforward logic)
4. ✅ **Process all players** (no special banker handling)
5. ✅ **Update agent balance** (agent is always banker)
6. ✅ **Send callback** (standard format)
7. ✅ **Return success** (simple response)

### **🔄 Original Rotation Behavior:**
- **Agent is always the banker** (no player-banker complexity)
- **All players processed normally** (no special skipping)
- **Simple response format** (no rotation metadata)
- **Automatic rotation handled by game server** (as it was working before)

## Response Format (Restored)

### **Before (Complex):**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "game_info": {
    "is_player_banker": true,
    "current_banker": "SKP0101", 
    "banker_type": "player",
    "rotation_status": "ready",
    "can_rotate_banker": true,
    "suggested_next_bankers": [...],
    "rotation_note": "..."
  }
}
```

### **After (Simple) ✅:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "wager_code": "...",
  "players": [...],
  "banker": {
    "player_id": "AG97617268",
    "balance": "99670.00"
  },
  "agent": {
    "player_id": "AG97617268", 
    "balance": "99670.00"
  }
}
```

## Benefits of Reversion

### **✅ Simplicity:**
- **No complex logic** that could cause issues
- **Straightforward flow** that was working before
- **Clear separation**: Agent = Banker, Players = Players

### **✅ Reliability:**
- **Proven working system** (was working before rotation changes)
- **No edge cases** from complex player-banker logic
- **Predictable behavior** for game server rotation

### **✅ Compatibility:**
- **Original callback format** that your game server expects
- **Same response structure** as before
- **No breaking changes** to client integration

## Expected Results

### **🎮 Game Server Rotation:**
Your game server's **automatic rotation should now work** exactly as it did before:

```
Round 1: Game server sends transaction → Agent handles banking → Success
Round 2: Game server rotates automatically → Agent handles banking → Success  
Round 3: Game server continues rotation → Agent handles banking → Success
```

### **🔄 No Interruptions:**
- ✅ **No "No agent found" errors**
- ✅ **No game stopping after one transaction**
- ✅ **Simple, predictable responses**
- ✅ **Automatic rotation continues seamlessly**

## Summary

**Restored the original, working rotation system** that was functioning properly before the complex banker logic was added. 

**Your game server's automatic rotation should now work exactly as it did before!** 🎯

The system is now:
- ✅ **Simple and reliable**
- ✅ **Compatible with existing game server logic**
- ✅ **Free from complex edge cases**
- ✅ **Back to the working state**
