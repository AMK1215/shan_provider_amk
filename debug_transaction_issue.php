TRANSACTION ISSUE ANALYSIS AND FIX EXPLANATION

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
==================
After 10 transactions, the system started receiving requests where:
- First "player" in the array was actually an AGENT username (e.g., "AG72360789")
- The system was trying to find this agent as a player, which failed
- This caused the "First player not found" error

EXAMPLE OF PROBLEMATIC REQUEST:
===============================
{
    "banker": {
        "player_id": "MKP0102",
        "player_name": "MKP0102", 
        "amount": 10010
    },
    "players": [
        {
            "player_id": "AG72360789",  // <-- THIS IS AN AGENT, NOT A PLAYER!
            "player_name": "AG72360789",
            "win_lose_status": 1,
            "bet_amount": 10,
            "amount_changed": 10
        },
        {
            "player_id": "MKP0103",     // <-- This is a real player
            "player_name": "MKP0103",
            "win_lose_status": 1,
            "bet_amount": 10,
            "amount_changed": 10
        },
        {
            "player_id": "MKP0101",     // <-- This is a real player
            "player_name": "MKP0101",
            "win_lose_status": 1,
            "bet_amount": 10,
            "amount_changed": 10
        }
    ]
}

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
==================

1. IMPROVED FIRST PLAYER LOOKUP:
   - If first "player" is not found as a player, check if it's an agent
   - If it's an agent, find a real player from the remaining array
   - Use that real player for agent lookup logic

2. ENHANCED AGENT DETECTION:
   - Check banker data to see if it contains agent information
   - Use banker as agent if it's an agent type (10 or 20)

3. SMART PLAYER PROCESSING:
   - Skip agents during player processing loop
   - Only process actual players (type 40)
   - Track actual players processed vs total in array

4. BETTER LOGGING:
   - Added detailed logging to track what's happening
   - Shows all player IDs in the request
   - Identifies when agents are mixed with players

HOW TO TEST THE FIX:
===================

Send a request with mixed player/agent IDs like the failing one:

POST /api/v1/shan-transaction-create
{
    "banker": {
        "player_id": "MKP0102",
        "amount": 10010
    },
    "players": [
        {
            "player_id": "AG72360789",    // Agent in player array
            "win_lose_status": 1,
            "bet_amount": 10,
            "amount_changed": 10
        },
        {
            "player_id": "MKP0103",       // Real player
            "win_lose_status": 1,
            "bet_amount": 10,
            "amount_changed": 10
        }
    ]
}

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
============================
1. System detects "AG72360789" is an agent, not a player
2. Finds "MKP0103" as a real player for agent lookup
3. Skips "AG72360789" during player processing
4. Only processes "MKP0103" as actual player
5. Transaction completes successfully

LOG OUTPUT AFTER FIX:
====================
You should see logs like:
- "ShanTransaction: First "player" is actually an agent, skipping to find real player"
- "ShanTransaction: Found real player for agent lookup"
- "ShanTransaction: Skipping agent in player processing"
- "actual_players_processed": 1 (instead of 2)

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
==================
It seems like after 10 transactions, the client-side system started including
agent information in the players array, possibly as part of a different 
transaction flow or game mode. The fix makes the system robust enough to
handle these mixed requests.

PREVENTION:
===========
Consider updating the client-side to send cleaner data, but this server-side
fix ensures compatibility with both clean and mixed request formats.
